DB1
    - 4 tables
        - people table
            - user id
            - username
            - user information
        - chat table
            - chat id 
            - user 1
            - user 2
            - messages
        - messages table
            - chat id
            - message
            - time of message
            - status of message
        - suspension table
            - user id
            - suspension status
            - time on suspension
                - null if no suspension
                - time remaining or time that suspension ends
                (if we do time remaining, we can avoid null and just have a difference 
                between time of start and time of end.  0 would equal no suspension)
                - UPDATE:
                    - We need to know past suspensions so maybe add a start date and an end date



Calculating 6 month difference given two dates:
    ((date1.year - date2.year) * 12) + date1.Month - date2.month
    Use case:
        Over 6 months: 02-22-2012 to 06-23-2013
        ((2013 - 2012) * 12) + 6 - 2 = 16
        Under 6 months: 03-12-2014 to 05-23-2014
        ((0)) + 5 - 3 = 2
        6 months exactly: 04-12-2015 to 10-22-2015
        ((0)) + 10 - 4 = 6

        Then we can use an if statement checking if the days in the later month is greater than the days in the lesser month

Calculating if date falls in between two given dates:
    if year falls in between years
        if month falls  between months
            if date falls  in between dates


MIGHT BE WORTH ADDING GLOBAL VARIABLES FOR IDs
